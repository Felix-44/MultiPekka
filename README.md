# PekkaZipper
A simple packager tool to create episode .zip files for the game Pekka Kana 2

Current features:
+ fast-ish packaging of any episode into a .zip file
+ sorta of "debugger" for episodes with the log command (currently not much, improvments planned)

Planned features/improvments:
+ faster packaging (if possible, probably not possible)
+ progress bar
+ display the time the packager took to finish a .zip [will be added in 1.1]
+ dezipper, basically the opposite of what packaging does
+ improved "debugging" [will be added a bit in 1.1]
