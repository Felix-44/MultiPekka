# PekkaZipper
A simple packager tool to create episode .zip files for the game Pekka Kana 2

Current features:
+ fast packaging of any episode into a .zip file
+ sorta of "debugger" for episodes with the log command (currently not too much, more improvments maybe planned)

Planned features/improvments:
+ progress bar [probably not, slows down too much]
+ dezipper, basically the opposite of what packaging does
+ more improvments for debugging if possible [maybe?]
