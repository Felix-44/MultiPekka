# PekkaZipper
A simple packager tool to create episode .zip files for the game Pekka Kana 2

Current features:
+ fast-ish packaging of any episode into a .zip file
+ sorta of "debugger" for episodes with the log command (currently not much, improvments planned)

Planned features/improvments:
+ faster packaging (if possible)
+ dezipper, basically the opposite of what packaging does
+ improved "debugging"
